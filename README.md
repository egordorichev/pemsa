Pemsa is a project, that aims to allow running PICO-8 carts the platforms, that are currently not officially supported, such as Nintendo Switch and Android.
The goal of the project is to emulate the runtime as closely as possible, including full RAM emulation and modified lua with fixed point numbers.

The emulator implements a backend system for easy porting to any platform, **if you want to run pemsa on your PC, have a look at [pemsa SDL2 backend](https://github.com/egordorichev/pemsa-sdl)**.
